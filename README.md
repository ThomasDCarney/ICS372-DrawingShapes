# ICS372-DrawingShapes
A program to draw and save simple shapes.

# Purpose
This is a simple drawing program where the user can create, select, move and delete simple shapes on a canvas... saving the design if they so chose. This was to illustrate and use the MVC design patter but also made use of the observer/observable and drawable patterns.
